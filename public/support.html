    <div class="faq">
        <p class="question">How does Couplr use my data?</p>
        <p class="answer">Couplr uses your Facebook posts and photos to determine who your closest friends might be in order to supply more intelligent random matches. However, we only request the friends associated or linked in your posts and photos — the things you say and the actual pictures you post on Facebook never even reach our app. After retrieving your data and using it to approximate your immediate social network, Couplr <i>immediately discards all post and photo data</i>, saving a compressed snapshot of the resulting social network onto our servers. <i>It is not possible for us (or anyone else) to determine the friends mentioned in any particular post or tagged in any particular photo</i> using this stored version of your network, so your data is safe!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <p class="question">Will Couplr ever post to Facebook?</p>
        <p class="answer">Couplr will never post to your Facebook. You are, however, more than welcome to brag to your friends about your matches.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <p class="question">The loading screen won’t go away.</p>
        <p class="answer">When your connection to the internet is particularly weak, you may experience long loading times. Try quitting and restarting the app (press the home button twice and swipe up on Couplr).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <p class="question">What does the alert saying “Social network too small” mean?</p>
        <p class="answer">Seeing this alert messages means that we were unable to find 9 or more friends for you to match. This might be due to one or more Facebook permissions being disabled. If this is the case, Couplr should automatically show you the missing Facebook permissions and allow you to approve them. You can also manually approve your permissions through Facebook — press on the “More” navigation button in the bottom right corner and scroll down to “Account Settings”. From there, navigate to “Apps" > "Logged in with Facebook” > "Couplr v2” and check the rest of the missing permissions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <p class="question">Will people be able to know who I matched?</p>
        <p class="answer">Your friends will <i>not</i> be able to know who you’re matching! Go on and let your inner cupid shine.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <p class="question">How do I undo a match I’ve done previously?</p>
        <p class="answer">Swipe right or press the watch icon to get to the history view, then find the match you wish to remove. Press the minus icon, and then the delete button to remove the match.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <p class="question">I submitted a match, but I don’t see it in my history.</p>
        <p class="answer">If you've voted the two friends you chose for the same title in the past, the new vote will not show. To confirm this, you should be able to find the match in your history view if you swipe all the way to the right.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <p class="question">I submitted a match, but my friend doesn’t see it on his or her app.</p>
        <p class="answer">It may take some time for matches to make their way onto our servers. To instantly push any new matches you’ve made onto our servers, just switch out of Couplr by pressing the home button.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <p class="question">A match shows up on my friend’s app but doesn’t show up when I use it.</p>
        <p class="answer">It is possible that a match that shows up on your friend’s profile or newsfeed contains people outside of your social network. If this is the case, the match will not be shown.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <p class="question">I want to stop using the app. How do I delete all of my matches?</p>
        <p class="answer">Just email one or both of the developers at whsieh@berkeley.edu or bassi.jeremy@gmail.com and we’ll take care of it for you.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <p class="question">Will my friends be able to know who I’m matched with?</p>
